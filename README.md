[Repository](https://github.com/TweetingCynical/code-refactor)

### Scope and Purpose

Review all HTML and CSS code and refactor to meet accessibility standards. Ensure the site does not change visually.

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

- Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
